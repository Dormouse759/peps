Abstract
========

This PEP introduces a special file, that can be put into a `__pycache__`
directory specifying that no pycache should be created.

Motivation
==========

[Clearly explain why the existing language specification is inadequate to address the problem that the PEP solves.]


Rationale
=========

The final installation of Python on most distributions tends to be quite large.
This is not always desirable, in some use cases (such as containers), there are
efforts to keep the filesystem as minimal as possible.


Specification
=============

The file may be put into the `__pycache__` direcotry as follows:

project/
└── __pycache__
    └── nocache_marker

This tells the interpreter that, upon import, it should not create a
bytecompiled cache for later use.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

This pep has no implications on backwards compatibility.

How to Teach This
=================

[How to teach users, new and experienced, how to apply the PEP to their work.]


Reference Implementation
========================

[Link to any existing implementation and details about its state, e.g. proof-of-concept.]


Rejected Ideas
==============

[Why certain ideas that were brought while discussing this PEP were not ultimately pursued.]


Open Issues
===========

[Any points that are still being decided/discussed.]
