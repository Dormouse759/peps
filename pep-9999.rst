Abstract
========

This PEP introduces a special file that can be put into a `__pycache__`
directory specifying that Python should not attempt to create bytecode cache
files.

Motivation
==========

[Clearly explain why the existing language specification is inadequate to address the problem that the PEP solves.]


Rationale
=========

The final installation of Python on most distributions tends to be quite large.
This is not always desirable, in some use cases (such as containers), there are
efforts to keep the filesystem as minimal as possible.


Specification
=============

The marker preventing pycache to be created may be put into the `__pycache__`
directory as follows::

    project/
    └── __pycache__
        └── nocache_marker

This tells the interpreter that, upon import, it should not create and write a
bytecompiled cache for later use. This works for subdirectories as well.

When the no cache marker is written into a `__pycache__` direcory, no pycache
will be generated anywhere from the level of the `__pycache__` directory and
below::

    foo/
    ├── __pycache__ <- Marked, top-level __pycache__
    │   └── nocache_marker
    ├── a.py
    ├── b.py
    └── bar
        ├── __pycache__ <- This __pycache__ is marked by the top-level __pycache__
        ├── c.py
        └── d.py

In this particular case, since there is a marker present in `foo/__pycache__/`,
no cache will be generated into `foo/bar/__pycache__/` either.

This file is empty and is never being read, the interpreter checks only for its
presence.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

This pep has no implications on backwards compatibility.
